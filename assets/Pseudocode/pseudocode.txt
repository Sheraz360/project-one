1. Create a HTML linked to CSS and JavaScript file and also include any necessary CSS and JavaScript libraries (Bootstrap, jQuery, FontAwesome).

2. Build the HTML structure:
   a. Create a navigation bar with the company logo and menu choices.
   b. Add a jumbotron with a large logo and slogan.
   c. Create a form with three inputs: Author, Title (optional), and Linecount (optional).
   d. Include a container element next to the form to display the results from the API.

3. Write JavaScript code to handle user interaction and API requests:
   a. Attach event listeners to the menu choices.
   b. When a choice is selected:
      - Send an AJAX request to the API, passing the selected choice and form inputs as parameters.
      - Retrieve the response data.
      - Format the data to display in the container element.
      - Update the container element with the formatted data.

4. Use CSS to style the app:
   a. Customize the navigation bar, jumbotron, form, and container to match desired design.
   b. Apply appropriate font, color, and layout styles.

5. Test the app:
   a. Verify that the form inputs are submitted correctly to the API.
   b. Check if the API response is displayed properly in the container.

6. Deploy the app

7. Continuously update and improve the app based on user feedback and requirements.
