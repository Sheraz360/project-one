TVOR - The Voice Of Reason

## Description

TVOR (The Voice Of Reason) is a web application that provides a platform for users to explore and discover poems. With TVOR, users can search for poems based on various criteria, such as Author, Title, or Line Count. The app leverages the PoetryDP API to fetch poem data and presents a list of matching poems for users to choose from. Upon selecting a poem, users can access the full text of the poem.

In addition to the search functionality, TVOR offers several features to enhance the user experience. Users have the flexibility to add multiple authors to their search criteria, allowing them to explore poems from different writers. The "My List" feature enables users to save their favorite poems, making it convenient to recall and access them in the future.

To personalize their experience, users can sign up and log in to TVOR. This grants them access to their personalized content, including their saved poems and preferences.

TVOR also includes two special sections. The "Poem of the Day" feature presents a new random poem each day upon clicking, offering users daily poetic inspiration. The "Authors of the Day" section displays three random author names that change every day, encouraging users to discover new poets and expand their literary horizons.
